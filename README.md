# VendingMachine Kata

Using Java - Maven/Spring Boot with either IntelliJ or Spring Tool Suite

This an rendition of the Vending Machine Kata where I attempted to use IntelliJ for Mac and Maven to build the solution. 

It is an non-working solution but the represents one way to code a solution for this.

I took a different approach to building this solution from the .Net solution in trying to get base entities represented. Once I did work on the .Net solution and did a different approach, This made me consider rework of the Java solution. 

Thank you, Tony
